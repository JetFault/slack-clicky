# Ideas

- Fuzzy Search
- Add FAQ section. ie: 'Q: A channel I want to send to isn't showing. A: Add it to the channel list in Slack and refresh in #Clicky'
- I still want to implement testing, so I plan on making a start on it at some point.
- Automate deployment? Not sure if this is possible with the Chrome Store but it's worth looking in to.
- Support other browsers, mainly Firefox and Safari.
