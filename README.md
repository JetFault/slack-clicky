slack-clicky
=================

Slack-Clicky is a chrome extension designed to make sharing a link to slack as fast and easy as possible.

As this is an early version, to use Slack-Clicky you must input your Slack API token into the `slackToken` variable in [app.js](https://github.com/joshfarrant/slack-clicky/blob/master/app.js#L1). You can then load the unpacked extension into Google Chrome and begin using Slack-Clicky.
